#What are negative indexes and why are they used?

"""Ans-->  In python we can use negative numbers as indexes to access in a sequence starting from the
           last item, The last element is referenced by -1 and the second-last element is referenced by -2
           and so on so on.

           Negative indexes has its own benifits like :
           1) They are easy to access elements from the end, in many cases you need to access the last
           or the second-last element in sequence and negative indexing provides a clean way to do this
           without having to calculate the length of the sequence.

           2) To reversing the sequence, negative indexes are also useful when you want to traverse or
           slice a sequence in reverse order.

           3) It improves readability, especially when accessing elements near the end of the sequence
           which might otherwise require cumbersome calculations involving the length of the sequence.
