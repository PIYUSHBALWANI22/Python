Introduction to exceptions and how to handle them using try, except, and finally.

-->  Theoretical Introduction to Exceptions

In Python, exceptions are a mechanism for handling errors that occur during the execution of a program. Theoretically, exceptions help manage unexpected or abnormal conditions without terminating the program abruptly.


 What are Exceptions?
1. Definition:
   - Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program's execution.
   - When an error occurs, Python raises an exception, which must be handled to avoid program termination.

2. Examples of Built-in Exceptions:
   - `ZeroDivisionError`: Raised when dividing by zero.
   - `FileNotFoundError`: Raised when a file is not found.
   - `ValueError`: Raised for invalid values, e.g., converting a non-numeric string to an integer.

3. Conceptual Flow:
   - When an exception occurs, Python stops execution and looks for exception-handling code (if provided).
   - If no handling code is present, the program terminates with an error traceback.


 Handling Exceptions with `try`, `except`, and `finally`

The `try-except-finally` structure is used to handle exceptions gracefully and ensure program stability.

1. `try` Block:
   - The code that might raise an exception is placed inside the `try` block.
   - If no exception is raised, the code runs normally.

2. `except` Block:
   - Code inside the `except` block runs if an exception is raised in the `try` block.
   - You can specify the exception type to handle specific errors or use a generic `except`.

3. `finally` Block:
   - Code in the `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.
   - It is used to release resources (e.g., closing files or database connections).


 Example 1: Handling Exceptions
```
try:
    numerator = int(input("Enter numerator: "))
    denominator = int(input("Enter denominator: "))
    result = numerator / denominator  # May raise ZeroDivisionError
    print(f"The result is {result}")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Please enter numeric values.")
finally:
    print("Execution completed.")
```

Explanation:
- If the user inputs invalid data, appropriate error messages are displayed.
- The `finally` block always runs, even if no exceptions occur.


 Example 2: Generic Exception Handling
```
try:
    file = open("nonexistent_file.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
except Exception as e:  # Catch any type of exception
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    print("End of file operation.")
```

Explanation:
- The `except Exception` block captures any exception and displays its message.
- The `finally` block ensures that the process concludes properly.


 Key Considerations
1. Specific Exceptions:
   - Use specific `except` blocks whenever possible to handle particular types of errors.

2. Multiple Exceptions:
   - A single `try` block can have multiple `except` blocks to handle various exceptions.

3. Optional `finally`:
   - The `finally` block is optional but highly useful for cleanup tasks (e.g., closing files or releasing resources).

4. Efficiency:
   - Avoid placing large sections of code in the `try` block. Only include the part that might raise an exception.


In theory, exception handling provides a structured way to deal with unexpected events in a Python program, ensuring robustness and reliability. It is a critical feature for writing professional-grade, error-tolerant applications.
