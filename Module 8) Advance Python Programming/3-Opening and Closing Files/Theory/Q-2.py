"""
Using the open() function to create and access files. 

--> The `open()` function in Python is a fundamental built-in function used for file handling operations. Theoretically, it allows the programmer to both create and access files while specifying the mode of operation.


 Theoretical Syntax
```
file_object = open(file_name, mode, buffering)
```
1. `file_name`: A string representing the name (and optionally, the path) of the file to open.
2. `mode`: Specifies the purpose of accessing the file, e.g., reading, writing, appending, etc.
3. `buffering`: An optional parameter to control buffering behavior (advanced feature, not frequently used).


 Creating and Accessing Files

# 1. Creating a File
- Files can be created by opening them in write (`w`), append (`a`), or exclusive creation (`x`) mode.
- If the file already exists:
  - `w`: Overwrites the file.
  - `a`: Opens the file for appending (does not erase existing content).
  - `x`: Raises a `FileExistsError`.

Example:
```
# Create a new file (or overwrite if it exists)
file = open("example.txt", "w")
file.write("This is a newly created file.")
file.close()

# Create a file exclusively
try:
    file = open("newfile.txt", "x")
    file.write("This file is created exclusively.")
    file.close()
except FileExistsError:
    print("File already exists!")
```


# 2. Accessing a File
- Files can be accessed in read (`r`) or read-write (`r+`) mode.
- If the file does not exist:
  - `r` mode raises a `FileNotFoundError`.
  - `r+` mode raises a `FileNotFoundError`.

Example:
```
# Access a file in read mode
try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
    file.close()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The file does not exist.")
```


# 3. Using the `with` Statement
The `with` statement is theoretically recommended for file operations as it ensures proper resource management (automatic closing of the file).

Example:
```
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
# File is automatically closed here
```


 Modes Overview for `open()`
| Mode   | Description                               | File Creation | Overwrite | Reading | Writing |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|---------|---------|
| 'r'  | Read only                               | No            | No        | Yes     | No      |
| 'w'  | Write only                              | Yes           | Yes       | No      | Yes     |
| 'a'  | Append only                             | Yes           | No        | No      | Yes     |
| 'r+' | Read and write                          | No            | No        | Yes     | Yes     |
| 'w+' | Write and read                          | Yes           | Yes       | Yes     | Yes     |
| 'a+' | Append and read                         | Yes           | No        | Yes     | Yes     |
| 'x'  | Exclusive creation (write only)         | Yes           | N/A       | No      | Yes     |


 Theoretical Considerations
- Closing Files: Failing to close files after operations may result in resource leaks. The `with` statement is ideal to address this concern.
- Error Handling: Proper error handling should be implemented, especially when working with non-existent files or attempting exclusive creation.

By using the `open()` function and its various modes, you can perform flexible and efficient file operations in Python.
