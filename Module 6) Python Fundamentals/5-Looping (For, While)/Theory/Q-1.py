Introduction to for and while loops.

--> Loops in programing allow the execution of a block of code multiple times, reducing reduandancy and making
    code more efficient. Python provides two types of loops:

    1) For loop :  The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance. It iterates over sequences
                   such as list, tuple, strings, and ranges.

        Key characters :

                        Used for iterating over sequences.

                        The number of iterations is predefined.

                        More readable when working with a fixed range of values.

    2) While loop :  The while loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as given condition is True. It is
                     used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

        Key charcters : 

                        Used when iterations depend on a condition rather than a sequence.

                        The loop runs indefinitely if the condition is never False (can lead to infinite loops if
                        not handeled properly).

                        Commonly used when waiting for specific event or user input.

    Both loops improve the efficiency of a program by reducing redundanncy and allowing repetitive tasks to be
    executed automatically.
