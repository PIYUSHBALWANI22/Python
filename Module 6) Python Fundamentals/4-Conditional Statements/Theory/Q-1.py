"""
Introduction to conditional statements: if, else, elif.

--> 
    1) if statement :   The if statement is used to execute a block of code only when a specified condition evaluates
                        to True. If the condition is False, the block skipped.

    2) if-else statement :  The if-else statement provides an alternative execution path. if condition is True, the corresponding
                            block runs, otherwise, the else block executes.

    3) if-elif-else statement :   The if-elif-else statement is used when multiple conditions need to be checked 
                                  sequentially. The elif block allows checking additional conditions. if none of the conditions 
                                  are True, the else block runs.
